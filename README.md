## Syfte
The purpuse of the examination project is to learn new techstacks and work with something we havent touched during the education. In my case this means React Native. 
Even though I've used React and different librarys using React like Next Ive never built an app before so I thought it would be fun and a nice experience to try and create a app with React Native. 

## Appen
The app im building is an dead project from SU. It was originally an project whose purpuse was to increace the compliance and insight of the young patience of Drottning Silvias barnsjukhus. Young kids and teens with chronic disases is an group that is very difficult for the healthcare proffesionalls to connect with and educate. It have been noted that this group have less knowledge and less understanding about their own diseases then adults. And with less knowledge comes less complaiance. So the idea is to give the kids a tool where they can track everything in a way thats familiar to them. They can track their medicins and add notes about them like for example : Why they stopped with a certain medicin, wich could come in handy years later when a new doctor tries to presrcibe the same medicin.  At the moment this happens often and the kids doesnt even know they already have tried the drug and they certanly doesnt know why they stopped taking it. But now they can keep track and tell the new doctor that they already tried it and that they stopped with it becouse of this reason or that reason.
 

## Interface för vårdgivare
The protoype in its current form doesnt support proper integration for the caregivers of the users. In its current form openAI is integrated to supply answers for the users questions. This is only for the sake of presentation and isnt ment for the actual application. Instead the idea is there would be an interface for the caregivers where they could fetch the users questions and also provide answers. An crude, elementary interface is provided on https://interface-halsokollen.vercel.app/
